    <summary>I can't recover my passwords!</summary>
    <p>
      You can use
      <a href="https://github.com/speezepearson/passman/blob/master/recover.py">this Python script</a>
      to recover them: in a terminal, run <code>pip install cryptodomex &amp;&amp; python recover.py html &lt; &lt;this file&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Cryptodome stopped being maintained or something: sorry, you'll have to roll up your sleeves and:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>UTF-8 encode your master password</li>
      <li>run that through SHA-256</li>
      <li>run that hash through PBKDF2 (with the parameters given by the encrypted payload's <code>keyDerivationAlgorithm</code>)</li>
      <li>use that key to decrypt the encrypted payload's <code>ciphertext</code> using the encrypted payload's <code>encryptionAlgorithm</code> (by default, AES-256 in Galois/Counter Mode).</li>

    <summary>Why does [UI feature] suck?</summary>
    Maybe one of:
    <ol>
      <li>I try hard to make sure none of your secrets end up anywhere the browser might cache them -- notably, the JavaScript console, and anywhere in the DOM. This is rather constraining.</li>
      <li>"Copy to clipboard" is only permitted as a direct result of a user action; no asynchronous copies are allowed. Unfortunately, the whole WebCrypto interface is asynchronous, so anything like "encrypt-and-copy" is impossible.</li>
